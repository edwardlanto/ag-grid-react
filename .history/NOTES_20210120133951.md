## Assumptions you made during the implementation process.

#### What stack am I going to use ? 

I looked at the question and I had a feeling I needed to pass state to other components, but instead of using Redux I went with something built in React Context API, saving space on dependancies. I know the concepts are practically the same so I went with that instead, though I could've set it up if needed. I am used to React Hook Form, the second I saw a form I went with that because its light & has amazing validation. I also have experience tabularizing data and I know AG Grid does wonders and is very robust. It has built in sorting, built in Grid API to select nodes & Overflow X scroll.

#### What is going to be a component?

A component should be self contained and independant of eachother. I built this project thinking of scale, meaning the form can be reusable for other pages to interact with other future grids. As for the Grid, I'd like to say its mainly a functional piece — it just needs the data so I made it reusable as well.

#### What are some real life examples that would be needed that arent in the challenge?

If I were to place this in the real world situation, I would always want my forms required & show meaningful errors where ever needed. I also thought about user experience and I wanted the "Delete" button to only show if there were rows selected, because row data I feel like is suppposed to have data or a button that does more than delete.


## Known limitations of your implementation.

#### Multidelete

In the beginning I was focused on adding a multidelete. I ran into issues comparing the "Select Row Indexes" to the original data. As per the challenge, I wanted to finish up on time & check all requirements, so I branched off and created a single delete function instead. 


## What you liked or didn't like.

I liked all of it, tested core fundamentals of programming. I enjoyed putting real world thinking into this test. A feature I'm proud of was I don't repeat the categories in the Select Dropdown.

``` 
if(categories.includes(data.category)) return;
setCategories([...categories, data.category]);
```

Another feature I enjoyed building was AG grid, because it was shorter and easier to understand than Material UI's.

``
    <AgGridReact
          rowData={globalState?.state.data}
          columnDefs={columnDefs}
          rowSelection="single"
          onGridReady={(params) => {
            setGridApi(params.api);
            setColumnApi(params.columnApi);
          }}
          onRowSelected={rowSelectionCallback}
          suppressHorizontalScroll={false}
          enableSorting={false}
        />
``

## The challenges you encountered.

#### SelectBox

I didn't want to use material UI, because its very bloated & I didn't feel like setting up Webpack & its not compatible for React Hook Form. Personally, I use Ant Design for CSS & animations, but wanted to try Material because it was in the package.json. But as I was building, I didnt use Material UI select, but the standard HTML one. But instead of giving me the "value" it was giving me an instance to the Select Box class. It was very weird and I will look into it after, but for time sake I went with Material UI.


#### GlobalState not a function

Towards the end of the project I wanted remove the categories that were not in the data table anymore. 
To do that was simple, just grab the globalState from the store because that data is in sync with evetything else — but I was wrong. It was saying it wasn't a function, but clearly it wasn't, but I was not calling any method on it, just mapping through it. I left it because it is still perfectly functional with extra features.


## Anything else you'd like to add.

Thank you so much for your time to look over my code and I appreciate the opportunity.
